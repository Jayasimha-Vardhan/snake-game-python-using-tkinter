# snake-game-python-using-tkinter
This is a classic Snake game built using Python and Tkinter. The game runs in a window using a canvas and keyboard controls.  You can move the snake using arrow keys, pause and resume the game, and restart anytime using the restart button. The score increases when the snake eats food, and the game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
